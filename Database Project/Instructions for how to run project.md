## Instructions
1. Assuming you have already downloaded the required software (XAMPP), download the project files from GitHub. (Download link for XAMPP: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)<br>

2. Run the web server<br>
This is achieved by running XAMPP Control Panel and pressing the Start buttons for Apache and MySQL.<br>

3. Access the database management menu by going to your preferred web browser, and type into the search bar “localhost/phpymyadmin.”<br>

4. Run the SQL script that came with the GitHub project files to set up the database and its tables.<br>
Please make sure to create the database before importing the SQL script, the database name being “db_loginsystem.”<br>

5. Put the folder titled “Database Project” in the htdocs folder<br>
You are able to access this folder by locating where you stored the xampp folder when you downloaded XAMPP, then proceeding to the htdocs folder.
NOTE: the content in htdocs folder should be deleted after downloading XAMPP before moving other files into it.

6. Access the index (login) page of the website through your preferred browser’s search bar by typing “localhost” and selecting the folder Database Project/ that appears in your browser’s window.<br>
